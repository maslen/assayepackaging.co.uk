        <p>Laminated means layered. A laminated pouch is therefore made up of different layers of material which are chosen for their individual properties.</p>
        <p>Most laminated pouches consist of PET or OPP which is the outer layer. This plastic material gives very good printability, total or partial matt finish and a high or medium melting temperature.</p>
        <p>The inner layer usually consists of PE which is thermosealable, has good hot tack for large bags, a combination of LLDPE/MDPE, white content for opacity and coextrusion.</p>
        <p>The inner and outer layers are laminated together to produce a reel of printed film which can be made into pre-formed pouches or supplied on the reel to a V.F.F.S. Packaging Machine.</p>
        <p>There are many different types of laminated pouches, in all shapes and sizes - Block Bottom, Stand Up, Doy Pack and Vacuum Pack to name a few. </p>
