        <p>The shrink sleeves are produced with printed plastic tubular film that is to be applied to the container and subjected to hot retraction through a specific retraction tunnel by hot air or steam.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The sleeve fits perfectly the required form and, if correctly applied, there is no trace of its presence, giving the impression of having a direct declaration on the container.</p>
        <p>The sleeve can cover entirely or partially the container and be used also as warrently seal.</p>
        <p>Thanks to special inks and coatings we can offer a wide range of high quality graphic solutions.</p>
